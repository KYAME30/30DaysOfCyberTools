# 30 Days of Cybersecurity Tools 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning 30 cybersecurity tools in 30 days.
Each day focuses on a specific tool, with notes, common commands, and usage examples.

## 📅 Structure
- `Day01` to `Day30`: Each folder contains notes and findings about one tool.
- `template.md`: A template you can copy for your daily notes.

## 🔥 Goal
- Learn the most important tools in cybersecurity (Red Team / Blue Team / Networking)
- Build a solid reference for myself and others in the community
